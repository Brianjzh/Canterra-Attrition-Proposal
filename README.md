## Features

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualizing relationships between age, income, job satisfaction, tenure, and attrition.
- **Key Trends**:
  - Higher turnover among employees under 25.
  - Increased attrition linked to income disparities and job dissatisfaction.
  - Frequent business travel correlates with higher attrition rates.

### **Predictive Models**
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Focused on binary classification of employee attrition.
  - Identified top predictors: job satisfaction, income, age, and tenure.
- **Decision Tree**:
  - Provided interpretable insights into decision paths.
  - Highlighted tenure, income, and age as key drivers of attrition.
- **Bagged Tree**:
  - Reduced variance and improved predictive stability.
  - High ROC AUC score of 0.943.
- **Random Forest**:
  - Best-performing model with ROC AUC of 0.972.
  - Accurately identified high-risk employees while minimizing overfitting.

### **Model Evaluation**
- **ROC Curves**:
  - Evaluated modelsâ€™ performance with both training and testing datasets.
- **Sensitivity and Specificity**:
  - Assessed true positives and negatives for each model.
- **Feature Importance**:
  - Analyzed key factors like income, job satisfaction, and age.
